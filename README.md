🚙🔋 E-Vehicles Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Tableau dashboard analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption, growth, and performance across regions. It provides insights into EV sales trends, adoption by state, charging range, and manufacturer contributions.

📊 Dashboard Contents
Worksheets Included

📈 EV Growth by Year – Trend of EV adoption over time

⚡ EV Growth – Annual (BEV vs PHEV) – Breakdown of Battery EVs vs Plug-in Hybrid EVs

🌍 EV Share (%) by State Map – State-wise adoption distribution

🔋 Avg Electric Range – Average range of EVs over time

📊 Electric Range Distribution (Histogram) – Range variation among vehicles

🔮 Forecast by Electric Range – Predicted trends based on range data

🚘 Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make – Leading manufacturers in EV adoption

📦 Total Vehicles – Overall count of EVs

⚡ Total BEV Vehicles – Count of Battery Electric Vehicles

⚡ Total PHEV Vehicles – Count of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles

🏷️ Total Vehicles by Model – Distribution by car model

📅 Total Vehicles by Model Year – Adoption trend across years

🗺️ Total Vehicles by State – Regional distribution

✅ Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility – Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle eligibility breakdown

🔗 Unity vs Type of EV – Comparison across EV types

📈 Key Insights

EV adoption has shown steady year-on-year growth.

Battery EVs (BEV) are gaining higher adoption compared to Plug-in Hybrid EVs (PHEV).

Some states show significantly higher EV penetration due to policy support.

Average electric range is increasing, making EVs more practical.

Top EV manufacturers dominate the market but new entrants are emerging.
